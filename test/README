This directory is intended for PlatformIO Unit Testing and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

##Comando-de-dois-motores-comunica--o-serial---Arduino-uno

#Includes:
#include <AccelStepper.h>


Very simple program that gets the value form a String and execute.

string to send - > vm1=200;vm2=200;stpm1=5000;stpm2=5500;acm1=50;acm2=10000;

So it means that:
vm1 = Speed of motor one
vm2 = Speed of motor two
stpm1 = Steps of motor one
stpm2 = Steps of motor two
acm1 = Acceleration of motor one
acm2 = Acceleration of motor two

after the string is received, it will be executed in the main loop.
