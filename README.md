# How to Control stepr Motor over usb

# Includes: include <AccelStepper.h>

### Very simple program that gets the value form a String and execute or save it on EEprom

## Recived string 
 - vm1=200;vm2=200;stpm1=5000;stpm2=5500;acm1=50;acm2=10000;delay=100;

So it means that:
- vm1 = Speed of motor one
- vm2 = Speed of motor two
- stpm1 = Steps of motor one
- stpm2 = Steps of motor two
- acm1 = Acceleration of motor one
- acm2 = Acceleration of motor two
- delay = The delay between each movement
- fim = indicate the end of a move
