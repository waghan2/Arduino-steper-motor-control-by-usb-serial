### Very simple program that gets the value form a String and execute.

## string to send - > vm1=200;vm2=200;stpm1=5000;stpm2=5500;acm1=50;acm2=10000;

So it means that:
vm1 = Speed of motor one
vm2 = Speed of motor two
stpm1 = Steps of motor one
stpm2 = Steps of motor two
acm1 = Acceleration of motor one
acm2 = Acceleration of motor two

## After the string is received, it will be executed in the main loop.
